# Module 2 Challenge

# Green Stocks
## Objective
We have a dual purpose on this challenge, help Steve to do a little more research for his parents, by expanding the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years, as well as seeing the impact of refactoring the code.
## Results
•	The stock performance was stagering better for 2017 than for 2018, clearly marked by the coloring aid (red negative, green positive).
•	When running the 2017 year, the  was a savings of 0.41 secs. See results for module vs challenge. Note that not every time you run it it will take the same time (to run), sometimes is faster.

## Summary 
•	Refactoring code can be a bit challenging, if we consider that each person has its own style and thus understanding and then modifying code written by other people will depend on how clear and well documented such code is. However, many times improving upon something can be more efficient/easier than starting from scratch, saving time in the long run.
•	For our challenge in particular, as seen when comparing the execution times with the module script vs the refactor (challenge) script, it is clear that the refactored one runs faster. Although 0.5 vs 0.1 secs might not seem like a huge time savings, 4 to 5 times faster depending on the year queried can be very significant if/when you run similar queries often.

•	Adding a clean screen button, is a good practice. In this code you can run the original worked through the module, the refactored and clean the screen between queries

•	Don't understatimate the power of small improvements, everything compounds.
